# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the project was to create summary dataframe for the ride sharing data by the city using Python and Pandas. Once the summary dataframe was created, a matplotlib multiple line chart was made to show total weekly fares for each city type.
## Results
Based on the chart, the very first observation is that the all 3 city types had an increase in total fare between the month of Febrary and March and then it dipped in March. Secondly, the urban citties had a constant increases and decreases in the total fares through the months of Feb,March,April, In April, the fares hit a pleateau and the prices dropped. However, the rural cities had a constant increase and decrease throughout all the months and the Suburban cities had a major increase between Feb-March as mentioned above and a dip after April. Besides that, Suburban cities were maintaining the fares all along.
## Summary
1. Since there are higher percentage of total rides in urban cities, more and more fare is collected. 
2. Due to less number of drivers in rural citites, there is no competition and the drivers earns what may be comparable to urban and Suburban cities.

### Recommendation
1. Riding services should be the same for all the city types. If urban cities have, private taxi services, uber, lyft etc, the same should be allowed in the rural areas. A little bit of competition in the rural area can subsidized high prices (that the drivers themselves can fix) for the riders living in these remote areas.
2. Increase the base fare for the across all cities and keep it same. The graph clearly shows that the urban starting price is $1800 and the rural is $200. So it is important to increase the rural cities base riding price.
3. Areas in extremely rural cities should get an advantage. Increase the number of drivers in these areas.
